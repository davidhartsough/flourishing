## Preface

### 0. The Universe

**Question**:

What is the universe? What's going on? (What is life, the universe, and everything?)

#### Premise #0: Interconnectedness

The universe is the complex interplay of interconnected, interrelated, interdependent systems wherein life and consciousness has emerged.

## 1. Value

**Question**:

What's most important? What matters most?

What is valuable? What has value?

What is intrinsically valuable? What has intrinsic value?

### Premise #1: Consciousness

**Answer**:

Consciousness is the origin of all value.

Conscious living beings and their conscious experiences are intrinsically valuable.

Life is the root intrinsic value.

> "Consciousness is the most important thing in the universe. It is the carrier of all value: actual and possible." — S.H.

## 2. Good

**Question**:

What is good? What is good for that which is most important / intrinsically valuable?

What is good, better, and best? What is ideal?

What is best for consciousness and conscious experience? What is best for life?

What are good conscious experiences? What is a good life?

### Premise #2: Flourishing

**Answer**:

Flourishing is good for conscious life and is the best conscious experience.

Flourishing is the ideal state of life and living — to be well and to live well.

The good life is a life of flourishing.

Flourishing is synonymous with well-being, well-living, and thriving.

## 3. Cause

**Question**:

What is the origin of goodness? What causes goodness? Where does good come from?

What determines the quality of consciousness and conscious experience? What determines the quality of life and living?

How do you determine the quality of your life and your living? How do you determine how good your life is and how well you are living it?

How do we evaluate states of being and experiences? How do we evaluate the quality of life?

### Premise #3: Systems

The interconnected, interrelated, and interdependent systems of life and conscious experience determine the quality of life.

The evaluation of the quality of life and living is relative to the emergent interplay of all these complex systems. Their interconnectedness, interrelationships, and interdependence outline the quality of your life.

Life is an emergent synthesis of these systems and its quality is contextually conditional on the state of this emergence.

Flourishing emerges from the symbiotic and synergistic relationships of these systems.

The quality of your life is determined by the quality of the interrelationships of your interconnected systems.

The quality of an experience is evaluated by its consequences/effects on the state of being of conscious living beings.

## 4. Factors

**Question**:

What are the most important factors of goodness? Which factors matter most?

What are the most essential elements and crucial components of the good life?

Which systems are the most significant determinants of flourishing?

Which factors have the most significant effect on the quality of life?

What is the most useful conceptual model, framework, breakdown, and outline of flourishing?

What are the most fundamental factors of flourishing?

### Premise #4: Social, Mental, Physical

The social, mental, and physical factors of life are the most significant determinants of flourishing.

The quality of your life is most determined by the quality of your relationships, mind, and body.

Evaluating the state of a conscious being's social, mental, and physical systems and their interrelationships is the best method of approach for estimating the quality of that conscious being's life and living.

Flourishing is best modeled as primarily being composed of social, mental, and physical flourishing, well-being, health, and thriving.

The best conceptual framework of flourishing focuses on a living being's relationships, mind, and body.

The three most important factors of flourishing are the mind, body, and relationships.

The quality of your life is determined by the quality of your relationships, mind, and body — your social, mental, and physical well-being, health, fulfillment, fitness, development, and growth.

Your mind, body, and relationships are the most fundamental factors of your flourishing.

Altogether, fostering flourishing looks like creating and cultivating moments and experiences of love.
